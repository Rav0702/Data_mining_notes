    "# Query Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Query processing is the process of retrieving relevant documents from a collection of indexed text based on a user's query. The process involves breaking down the query into individual terms and searching the index for documents that contain those terms. The results are then ranked based on relevance and presented to the user. Query processing is an important part of information retrieval systems, such as search engines, that allow users to quickly find relevant information from large collections of text.\n",

    "# Posting Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "List compression is a technique used in indexing text to reduce the amount of space needed to store posting lists. It involves storing only the differences between adjacent docIDs instead of the full docID. This approach can greatly reduce the amount of space needed to store posting lists, especially for collections with many small documents or for indexes with many terms. However, it also requires additional processing during query processing to reconstruct the full docID from the compressed representation.\n",
